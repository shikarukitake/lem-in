# Lem-in
The goal of this project is to find the quickest way to get n ants across the farm. To achieve the best efficiency Bellman-Ford and Suurballe's algorithms were used for finding the shortest disjoint paths in a graph. The graph is represented by an adjacency list in order to get a low time and memory complexity. Number of needed paths depends on the amount of ants.
